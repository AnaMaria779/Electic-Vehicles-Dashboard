# ⚡ Electric Vehicles Dashboard - Excel Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an interactive **Electric Vehicles Dashboard** built in **Microsoft Excel**. It provides insightful analytics on electric vehicle (EV) registrations, trends, and key performance metrics through dynamic visualizations.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔄 **Interactive Slicers** for filtering data by:  
  - **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility**  
  - **Electric Vehicle Type**  
  - **Model**  
- 📊 **Dashboards with Key Metrics**:  
  - **Top 10 Vehicles by Model**  
  - **Pie Chart: CAFV Eligibility Distribution**  
  - **Top 10 Best Avg Electric Range (km) by Make (Full Charge)**  
  - **Number of Vehicles by State**  
  - **Electric Vehicles Registered by Model Year**  
  - **Total Vehicles**  
  - **Total BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles)**  
  - **Total PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles)**  
- 🌍 **Geographical Insights** (State-based EV distribution)  
- ⚡ **Performance Metrics** (Electric range analysis by model)  
- 🌟 **User-Friendly Design** (Professional dashboard layout for easy navigation)  

## 📺 Dataset  
The dashboard utilizes EV registration data, including:  
- **Vehicle Information** (Make, model, and type)  
- **CAFV Eligibility** (Clean energy certification status)  
- **Electric Range** (Maximum distance after full charge)  
- **Registration Details** (State and model year)  

## 🛠️ Requirements  
- **Microsoft Excel 2016 or later** (for optimal functionality)  
- **Power Query & Pivot Tables enabled** (for dynamic filtering)  

## 📌 Usage  
1. **Download the Excel file** from the repository.  
2. **Open it in Excel** (ensure macros & data connections are enabled).  
3. **Use the interactive slicers** to filter and analyze EV data.  
4. **Review insights** through the pre-built dashboards.
